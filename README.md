** Predictive Maintenance for Power Transformers in a Power Plant **

In the realm of power generation, ensuring the reliability and longevity of critical equipment such as transformers is paramount. This project focuses on the implementation of predictive maintenance for power transformers in a central power plant, leveraging a dataset containing chemical elements present in the transformers. The fluctuation in the concentration of these elements serves as an indicator of potential anomalies within the transformers.

The project commences with a comprehensive data exploration phase. By employing statistical functions like `describe()`, an understanding of the data's structure and distribution is gained. The dataset includes a 'Health' column representing the dependent variable, along with several columns of chemical elements serving as independent variables. To enhance model performance, the independent variables are standardized.

Visualization is a crucial step in comprehending the dataset. Two types of visualizations are considered: one with scaled features and one without. Scaling is essential to ensure that no particular feature dominates the others due to differences in scale, guaranteeing a fair contribution from each element during model training.

The eigen-decomposition of the dataset is computed as part of the exploration. This process involves breaking down the dataset into its principal components, shedding light on the intrinsic patterns within the data.

Given the imbalance in the dataset, where instances of anomaly outweigh those of a healthy transformer, a combination of undersampling and oversampling techniques is employed to achieve a more balanced dataset. This facilitates the training of machine learning models on a representative set of instances.

The initial model chosen for training is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from the scikit-learn library. SVM is preferred for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships. The model yields promising results, achieving an accuracy of 85%. To further evaluate model performance, a confusion matrix is generated, providing insights into true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

Recognizing the importance of anticipating anomalies, a cost function is incorporated into the model. This function quantifies the cost associated with model errors, providing a holistic evaluation of predictive performance.

Subsequent model testing involves the exploration of various algorithms to identify the one that performs optimally with the introduced cost function. Notably, Logistic Regression emerges as the model with the highest performance, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting transformer health.

In conclusion, this predictive maintenance project combines data exploration, feature scaling, eigen-decomposition, and a thoughtful selection of machine learning models to create a robust system for anticipating anomalies in power transformers. The integration of a cost function adds a layer of practicality, aligning the model's predictions with real-world consequences and contributing to the overall reliability of power plant operations.
